# 👥 Team Management System

## 📋 Overview

The AI Content Repurposer Studio now features a **Direct Team Member Addition** system that allows team owners and admins to instantly create team member accounts with full credential control.

## 🔧 System Features

### ✨ **Direct Member Addition**

```

## 📋 **Best Practices**
