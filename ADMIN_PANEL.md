## Development

### Adding New Features

2. Add API endpoints in `src/app/api/admin/[feature]/`
3. Update the navigation in `src/app/admin/layout.tsx`
4. Ensure proper authentication validation

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials on `/admin`
2. Credentials validated against environment variables
3. JWT token generated and returned
4. Token stored in localStorage
5. Token included in Authorization header for API requests
6. Token validated on each protected route

## Production Deployment

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Change default admin credentials
- [ ] Use strong, unique passwords
- [ ] Generate secure JWT secret
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Configure proper CORS policies
- [ ] Set up access logging
- [ ] Regular security audits

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Production environment variables
ADMIN_USERNAME=your-admin-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-very-secure-password
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=your-cryptographically-secure-jwt-secret-256-bit
```

### Recommended Security Measures
1. Use environment-specific credentials
2. Implement rate limiting on login endpoint
3. Add IP whitelisting for admin access
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Regular password rotation
6. Consider implementing 2FA

## Troubleshooting

### Login Issues
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
